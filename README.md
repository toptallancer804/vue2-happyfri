Router Configuration
```
import App from '../App'

export default [{
    path: '/',
    component: App,
    children: [{
        path: '',
        component: r => require.ensure([], () => r(require('../page/home')), 'home')
    }, {
        path: '/item',
        component: r => require.ensure([], () => r(require('../page/item')), 'item')
    }, {
        path: '/score',
        component: r => require.ensure([], () => r(require('../page/score')), 'score')
    }]
}]
```
Configuration of Actions
```
import ajax from '../config/ajax'

export default {
    addNum({ commit, state }, id) {
        commit('REMEMBER_ANSWER', id);
        if (state.itemNum < state.itemDetail.length) {
            commit('ADD_ITEM_NUM', 1);
        }
    },
    initializeData({ commit }) {
        commit('INITIALIZE_DATA');
    }
}
```
Mutations
```
const ADD_ITEM_NUM = 'ADD_ITEM_NUM'
const REMEMBER_ANSWER = 'REMEMBER_ANSWER'
const REMEMBER_TIME = 'REMEMBER_TIME'
const INITIALIZE_DATA = 'INITIALIZE_DATA'
export default {
    [ADD_ITEM_NUM](state, payload) {
        state.itemNum += payload.num;
    },
    [REMEMBER_ANSWER](state, payload) {
        state.answerId[state.itemNum] = payload.id;
    },
    [REMEMBER_TIME](state) {
        state.timer = setInterval(() => {
            state.allTime++;
        }, 1000)
    },
    [INITIALIZE_DATA](state) {
        state.itemNum = 1;
        state.allTime = 0;
    },
}
```
Store Creation
```
import Vue from 'vue'
import Vuex from 'vuex'
import mutations from './mutations'
import actions from './action'

Vue.use(Vuex)

const state = {
    level: 'First Week',
    itemNum: 1,
    allTime: 0,
    timer: '',
    itemDetail: [],
    answerId: {}
}

export default new Vuex.Store({
    state,
    actions,
    mutations
})
```
Creating Vue Instance
```
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueRouter from 'vue-router'
import routes from './router/router'
import store from './store/'

Vue.use(VueRouter)
const router = new VueRouter({
    routes
})

new Vue({
    router,
    store,
}).$mount('#app')
```
